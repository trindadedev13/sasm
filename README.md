# SASM (Simulated Assembly)
- SASM is a simple language inspired by assembly.
  
## JMP, CALL & RET
### JMP
- Jumps to a label and continues the flow there.
- Usage:
```asm
main:
  JMP some
  MOV A, 0x00 ; Never execute
some:
  ; Continues from here...
```

### CALL & RET
- Jumps to a label, but Returns to caller when done.
- Usage:
```asm
main:
  CALL some
  MOV A, 0x00 ; After some returns, will be executed
some:
  ; Do something
  RET ; Returns to caller (main)
```

## Interrupts
### INT 0x80
- Interrupt 80 is the Interrupt for #Syscalls.
- Usage:
```asm
MOV     D, <SyscallNumber>  ; The syscall
INT     0x80                ; The interrupt
```

## Syscalls
### 0x01 - PUTI
- Put Int, Print a integer in stdout
- A = int
- Usage:
```asm
MOV     A, 0x01  ; integer 1
MOV     D, 0x01  ; syscall PUTI
INT     0x80     ; perform syscall
```

### 0x02 - PUTC
- Put Char, Print a char in stdout
- A = char
- Returns in A = Bytes writter
- Usage:
```asm
MOV     A, 0x0A  ; char A in hexa
MOV     D, 0x02  ; syscall PUTC
INT     0x80     ; perform syscall
```

### 0x03 - EXIT
- Exit the program with status code.
- A = status code.
- Usage:
```asm
MOV     A, 0x00  ; 0 in hexa
MOV     D, 0x03  ; syscall EXIT
INT     0x80     ; perform syscall
```
